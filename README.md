This is a multiple distorted High dynamic range Stereoscopic Omnidirectional Image Dataset (NBU-SHOID) containing JPEG XT encoding distortion and tone mapping distortion. The original source of the dataset is the Multimedia Signal Processing Laboratory of Ningbo University and is recognized in any publication that uses the dataset for research. The dataset will be referenced as :Liuyan Cao, Gangyi Jiang, Mei Yu, Yong Chao, and Yo-sung Ho "Quality Assessment for High Dynamic Range Stereoscopic Omnidirectional Image Processing System", In the process of submission. We will publish the dataset once the article is accepted.
